# Information Studies (IS) Master Thesis Templates
Here you find the official templates for all of the work you will conduct in light of your Information Studies MSc thesis. These templates should serve to kickstart your work and allow you to produce content from day 1.

In this repository you will find four templates:
- [LaTeX] In case you want to conduct an _independent_ project, a `project-proposal` template under `latex-template/setups/0-project-proposal.tex`
- [LaTeX] A template for your _required_ `thesis-design` under `latex-template/setups/1-thesis-design.tex`
- [LaTeX] A template for your final `thesis` under `latex-template/setups/2-thesis.tex`
- [IPYNB] A jupyter notebook for your `exploratory-data-analysis` (in the equally-named folder) including a `requirements.txt` and a sample image/rendering

You will find a specific `README.md` file in the `latex-template` folder which illustrates how to import the template in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and how to work offline. For both you will want to make use of the `latex-template.zip` file in this root folder.
