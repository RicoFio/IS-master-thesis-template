# Information Studies (IS) Master Thesis LateX Template
This is the official LateX template for your Information Studies and Data Science MSc thesis. It includes all the files necessary for writing a great thesis and should streamline the process of formatting such that you can focus on what is important, the content.

The folder structure follows the expected thesis structure:
- **Abstract:** A summary of results should be included. Avoid citations. Maximum length is 200 words.
- **Introduction:** Mention scientific field, problem statement, research gap and each research question. 
- **Related Work:** Your work needs to be grounded and compared to earlier work and the state-of-the-art.
Write about your related work here.
- **Methodology:** Focus on what you add to the existing method. Explain what you will do and why (and how).
Write about your methodology here.
- **Experiments:** Present all the settings used in your experiments. Everything you do should be reproducible.
Write about your experimental setup here.
- **Results:** Give the outcomes for each research question in the form of a table or graphic (with caption).
Write about your results here.
- **Discussion:** Compare your results with the state-of-the-art and reflect upon the results and limitations of the study.
Write your discussion here.
- **Future Work:** Give an outlook on what could be added to your work or what further research it could enable.
- **Conclusion:** Answer each research question and go into how the limitations of the study qualify the conclusion.

Obviously, this structure is flexible, but in general this is how not only a thesis but also papers and in general great research work is strucutred.
